<p>I'll recap a bit the experience for future reference.</p>
<p>Code for this ongoing project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/apiraino/poor-postman">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, I would't mind pulling out a basic tutorial out of this experience.</p>
<h2 id="assess-my-rust-proficiency"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#assess-my-rust-proficiency" aria-label="Anchor link for: assess-my-rust-proficiency">&sect;</a>
Assess my Rust proficiency</h2>
<p>Starting to get comfortable with Rust and its quirks, still uncomfortable with the Rust memory model. Never used GTK before, have a general idea of how a GUI application work.</p>
<h2 id="day-1"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#day-1" aria-label="Anchor link for: day-1">&sect;</a>
Day 1</h2>
<h3 id="where-did-i-start"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#where-did-i-start" aria-label="Anchor link for: where-did-i-start">&sect;</a>
Where did I start</h3>
<p>I tried my usual &quot;brute force&quot; approach when learning something new: skip tutorials and documentation, get a working codebase, try to figure out the basics by reading the code and have something working with a lot of copy and paste.</p>
<p>I used as a starting point a workshop that <a href="https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez">Guillaume</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sdroege">Sebastian</a> held at the <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop">RustFest '18 in Rome</a>.</p>
<p>I liked how the application was structured: as a GUI application tends to have boiler-plate (to build the GUI itself, of course!), I want to keep this boiler-plate separated from the business logic, and even better split the GUI code in submodules, each with its own responsibility. This way, the application can grow without getting messy.</p>
<p>However, after writing a working sample application doing some wild copy-pasting, this tutorial didn't work very well for me, I got a bit lost in some details that I will explain below, so I've started from scratch with a clean slate.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-clear-and-helpful"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-was-clear-and-helpful" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-was-clear-and-helpful">&sect;</a>
What was clear and helpful</h3>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples">examples repo</a> I could hack together some simple examples, although perhaps not ideal in real-life applications, e.g. all the code in the <code>main</code> method does not tell you much about idiomatic GTK applications.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-confusing"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-was-confusing" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-was-confusing">&sect;</a>
What was confusing</h3>
<p>In general the code from the workshop helped me figuring out the basics, but also raised some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The memory management with macro like <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop/blob/master/src/macros.rs#L4">upgrade_weak()</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop/blob/master/src/app.rs#L207">downgrade()</a> is (for me) an advanced topic that set me off.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples/blob/5b9c4b2d86a47ed3a5014ec723f3613ce3231827/src/bin/child-properties.rs#L19">macro replacing it</a> helps but it has some downsides (that macro will be rewritten in the future), but anyway nothing a newbie should worry about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>async</code> macro defined <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop/blob/master/src/macros.rs#L19">here</a> appears to be not needed anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any button with multiple states (represented by an <code>Enum</code>), did I had to implement <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop/blob/master/src/app.rs#L108">all these methods</a>? Example:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum ButtonState {
    Enabled,
    Disabled,
}

impl&lt;&#x27;a&gt; From&lt;&amp;&#x27;a glib::Variant&gt; for ButtonState {
    fn from(v: &amp;glib::Variant) -&gt; ButtonState {}
}

impl From&lt;bool&gt; for ButtonState {
    fn from(v: bool) -&gt; ButtonState {}
}

impl From&lt;ButtonState&gt; for glib::Variant {
    fn from(v: ButtonState) -&gt; glib::Variant {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>This seems not to be needed anymore, but it is confusing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do I need to <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop/blob/master/src/app.rs#L34">wrap</a> my App struct with layers or <code>Rc</code> and dereferencing methods? Why don't I need to do all this when building a <a href="https://github.com/sdroege/rustfest-rome18-gtk-gst-workshop/blob/master/src/app.rs#L34">simpler example application</a>? Am I leaking memory if I don't?</p>
<p>The general question for me is: do I need to wrap Structs to not leak memory? How do I know if my application is leaking memory?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these questions found an answer in the following days.</p>
<h3 id="accomplishments-of-today"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#accomplishments-of-today" aria-label="Anchor link for: accomplishments-of-today">&sect;</a>
Accomplishments of today</h3>
<p>After throwing away the first application stub, I've rewrote a second prototype, leveraging what I've learned but keeping things simpler. The second try went much better, I gained a basic understanding on how to structure a basic Gtk without stuffing everything into the <code>main.rs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="day-2"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#day-2" aria-label="Anchor link for: day-2">&sect;</a>
Day 2</h2>
<p>During the night, while I was wearing off the Club Mate, I've decided that it was boring to just hack together a useless GTK app showcasing just random widgets without a purpose. Therefore I thought that it could be interesting to draft a basic simple &quot;clone&quot; of <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, the great tool to test APIs.</p>
<p>What I need is:</p>
<ul>
<li>An input widget to enter a URL</li>
<li>A text widget with a listener to paste the HTTP response into (with some nice formatting, maybe)</li>
</ul>
<p>I can leverage and get quickly out of the way the HTTP part using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reqwest">reqwest</a>. And to add some spice to the receipt, why not making it asynchronous, so the main GUI thread is not blocked until the remote server answers.</p>
<p>A quick question lead to a simple answer: spawn a thread inside the event manager of the input widget. Here's a succint version of the implementation:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">&#x2F;&#x2F; create a transmit&#x2F;receive facility
let (tx, rx) = glib::MainContext::channel(glib::PRIORITY_DEFAULT);

&#x2F;&#x2F; create the text widget and its text buffer
let response_container = gtk::TextView::new();
let buf = response_container.get_buffer().expect(&quot;dang!&quot;);
buf.set_text(&quot;Hey, placeholder text&quot;);

&#x2F;&#x2F; spawn the thread when the user press &lt;Return&gt; on the input URL
&#x2F;&#x2F; pass the transmitter
url_input.connect_activate(clone!(tx =&gt; move |_| {

    let client = reqwest::Client::new();

    thread::spawn(clone!(tx =&gt; move || {
        let mut resp = client
            .post(...)
            .send()
            .expect(&quot;Request failed&quot;);
        let resp_data : Value = resp.json().unwrap();

        &#x2F;&#x2F; send result to channel
        tx.send(format!(&quot;{}&quot;, resp_data))
            .expect(&quot;Couldn&#x27;t send data to channel&quot;);
    }));
}));

&#x2F;&#x2F; attach the receiver, write the text into the buffer
rx.attach(None, move |response_data| {
    buf.set_text(&amp;response_data);
});

What was confusing</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had to figure out a bit of Gtk &quot;parlance&quot;, example:<pre data-lang="rust" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust">Gtk::Button::set_sensitive(bool) = to enable&#x2F;disable a button

Accomplishments of today</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Removed all the code that yesterday I've found confusing, things seems to work either way: no idea if I broke anything :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understood a bit better how to read the GTK-rs APIs (example: the difference between <code>Entry</code> and <code>EntryExt</code>), where to look for methods implemented by widgets, where to look for events (<code>connect_*</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a thread &quot;spawner&quot; inside a widget event manager</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#day-3" aria-label="Anchor link for: day-3">&sect;</a>
Day 3</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I could not participate as I was offlined due to previous arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="day-4"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#day-4" aria-label="Anchor link for: day-4">&sect;</a>
Day 4</h2>
<p>Today I tried experimenting with more new things. <a href="https://github.com/antoyo">@antoyo</a> showed me his shiny new toy <a href="https://github.com/antoyo/relm">relm</a> to create a GUI application using a declarative approach based on macros.</p>
<p>A really seducing way to create GUI applications, because - like we discussed - the GUI code shouldn't get in my way, I want to concentrate on the &quot;business logic&quot; of the application.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the first try didn't go too far as I got a bit lost in importing the right <code>relm_*</code> crates and macros. That looks like a stupid reason to be blocked :-) but at some point I've stashed the branch and got back the &quot;classic&quot; way. I'll definitively check <code>relm</code> at a later stage.</p>
<p>Today I've added a simple Http client (leveraging the <code>reqwest</code> crate), and a couple more widgets and started testing this simple application.</p>
<p>Things got slower because I tried decoupling the business logic of the application, doing weird things like trying to move and handle gtk objects far from their context. I couldn't make sense of what I was doing, so I gave up.</p>
<p>As the last day went on, I felt more and more tired so as I produced less and less code I was trolling more and more the gtk-rs team :-) I've forked the gtk-rs repo and stashed some small PR that I hope to push real soon, in time for the next major release.</p>
<p>It is absolutely great to have maintainers behind your back giving explainations and encouraging you to submit PRs even for trivial things. This is the best part of the open-source development.</p>
<p>But in the end I've accomplished less that I wanted, that's price to pay for experimenting :-)</p>
<h3 id="what-was-confusing-2"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-was-confusing-2" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-was-confusing-2">&sect;</a>
What was confusing</h3>
<ul>
<li>I didn't not manage to <em>quickly</em> hack together a new version of the application using relm</li>
<li>Rust quirks got again in the way</li>
</ul>
<p>But that was basically all I can complain for this day.</p>
<h3 id="accomplishments-of-today-2"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#accomplishments-of-today-2" aria-label="Anchor link for: accomplishments-of-today-2">&sect;</a>
Accomplishments of today</h3>
<ul>
<li>Got a bit more comfortable with the GUI code and how it's meant to be written</li>
<li>Added a (yet unfinished) Http client to manage the connections</li>
<li>Prepared a small PR for the <code>gtk-rs</code> main repository (that likely will be merged before the next main release)</li>
<li>Learned a bit more on how to correctly stack widgets horizontally and vertically and how to lay down things like you imagine them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-acknowledgements"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#general-acknowledgements" aria-label="Anchor link for: general-acknowledgements">&sect;</a>
General acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The <strong>amazing</strong> gtk-rs people doing an <strong>amazing</strong> job on the Gtk tookit.</p>
<p>The <strong>amazing</strong> gtk-rs people patiently explaining me a lot of basic stuff :-)</p>
<p><a href="https://apiraino.github.io/gtk-rs-first-experience/kinvolk.io">kinvolk.io</a> for hosting the whole band and fueling us with an endless stream of caffeine.</p>
<p>Once again the Rust developer community proved to be incredibly competent and helpful.</p>
<p>It was great meeting again the gtk-rs and some really good friends.</p>
<p>I couldn't have asked more from a workhop.</p>
<p>As an unexpected bonus, experienced Gtk-rs developers and maintainers were really interested in my questions and feedback to understand where the pain points were to a complete newbie with no prior experience of the toolkit. This report is also for them!</p>
