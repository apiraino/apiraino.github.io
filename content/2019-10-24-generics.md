Today I've learned a little about refactoring code using Generics.

### (Don't) fix what ain't broken

I had [some code](https://apiraino.github.io/2019/08/13/rust-getting-into-iterators.html) that worked well. Let's recap step by step the main points.

I have a Trait with a `extract_data()` method. This method does nothing :-) I also have two structs for different kind of data:
``` rust
trait CommonBehaviourTrait {
    fn extract_data(&self) {
        debug!("Default empty implementation");
    }
}

struct AgencyStruct {
    location: String
}

struct MemberStruct {
    name: String
}
```

I'm implementing the `extract_data()` method for both structs. The actual work done depends on the struct. We see that the `mapper()` function comes from different modules. While the name of the function is the same, the implementation might be different.

``` rust
impl CommonBehaviourTrait for Vec<AgencyStruct> {
    fn extract_data(&self) {
        agency_utils::mapper(self);
    }
}

impl CommonBehaviourTrait for Vec<MemberStruct> {
    fn extract_data(&self) {
        member_utils::mapper(self);
    }
}
```

Let's see what `mapper()` does for `AgencyStruct`:
``` rust
pub fn mapper<'a, I>(src: I) -> impl Iterator<Item = CommonStruct> + 'a
where
    I: IntoIterator<Item = &'a AgencyStruct>,
    <I as std::iter::IntoIterator>::IntoIter: 'a,
{
    src.into_iter().map(|list_item| {
        let res = CommonStruct::try_from(list_item)
}
```

Which reads as: this function take an object `I`, an iterator (`IntoIter`, i.e. a trait that implements the `Iterator` itself) of `AgencyStruct` with an attached lifetime `'a`. The lifetime is valid for all items inside the iteration plus the iterator itself. The body of the function iterates `src` and remap the content to `CommonStruct` (a data structure that remaps different things to the same content). The function returns another iterator, this time of our `CommonStruct` type. The same lifetime `'a` is attached to the returning value.

The `try_from` invoked there takes the reference to `AgencyStruct` and returns a new instance of `CommonStruct` (or an `ItemCreationError`):
``` rust
impl TryFrom<&AgencyStruct> for CommonStruct {
    type Error = ItemCreationError;

    fn try_from(src: &Agencystruct) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        CommonStruct {
            data: src.location
        }
}
```

I was so proud of this code (written with heavy guidance on how to use iterators and the `where` clause), but a friend of mine decided to break my application with an innocent remark: "why don't we make a generic implementation?". And he is right, there is a lot of boilerplate here!

Ok, let's try a refactor.

### Generics at work

First thing, we want to replace the specific type `AgencyStruct/MemberStruct` stuff with a generic type `T`, to be able to pass anything to the function.

``` rust
 pub trait CommonBehaviourTrait {
    fn extract_data(self)
    where
        Self: std::marker::Sized,
    {
         debug!("Default implementation of CommonBehaviourTrait");
     }
}

impl<T> CommonBehaviourTrait for Vec<T>
where
    T: TryInto<CommonStruct, Error = ItemCreationError> + Sized,
{
    fn extract_data(self) {
         let expimp_data = mapper(self);
     }
 }
```

With this I could remove all the specific implementations of the Trait. Notable changes:
- Changing `&self` to `self` means that now the compiler needs to know that the object passed is `Sized`: a reference has a known compile-time size, but a copy of an object doens't.
- The new `TryInto` says: "`T` must be anything that can be turned into a `CommonStruct` (or returns an `ItemCreationError`) and that you know the size at compile-time (`Sized`).

The `mapper()` function is then refactored as follows. Let's the diff for clarity:

``` diff
+pub fn mapper<I, T>(src: I) -> impl Iterator<Item = CommonStruct>
 where
-    I: IntoIterator<Item = &'a MyStuff>,
-    <I as std::iter::IntoIterator>::IntoIter: 'a,
+    I: IntoIterator<Item = T>,
+    T: TryInto<CommonStruct, Error = ItemCreationError> + Sized,
 {
     src.into_iter().map(|course| {
-        let res = CommonStruct::try_from(course);
+        let res = course.try_into();
         match res {
             ...
```

Changes:
- We've removed the lifetime `'a` from `src`, now we are not passing a reference anymore
- `I` is now a `T` generic parameter
- The `T` generic parameter is defined as we described a moment ago (an object that implements a TryInto etc. etc.).
- Since `src` iterator implements `TryInto`, now we can also call its items with `.try_into()` (not sure if this was needed).

### Closing notes

This is how the `TryFrom` I was using before is defined.

[Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.TryFrom.html) and [source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/convert.rs.html#482):

``` rust
pub trait TryFrom<T>: Sized {
    /// The type returned in the event of a conversion error.
    type Error;

    /// Performs the conversion.
    fn try_from(value: T) -> Result<Self, Self::Error>;
}
```

This is how the `TryInto` is defined.

[Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.TryInto.html) and [sources](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/convert.rs.html#557-564):

`impl<SpecificType, CommonStruct> TryInto<CommonStruct> for Specifictype`

``` rust
impl<T, U> TryInto<U> for T where U: TryFrom<T>
{
    type Error = U::Error;

    fn try_into(self) -> Result<U, U::Error> {
        U::try_from(self)
    }
}
```

There's a tricky part in `TryInto` that got us lose some time; we were confused by the ordering of `U` and `T`.

Another comment that I received looking at the refactored code is: you could have done that more easily with a macro, instead of getting crazy with that `where` clauses.

Thanks to [@tglman](https://gitlab.com/tglman) for causing all this trouble :-) and patiently teach me something really cool!
