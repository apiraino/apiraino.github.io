            <p>A website without I could not possibly be productive.</p>
<p>Its success tells a lot about the huge amount of tiny and fragmented knowledge is necessary to have when working in the information technology. As an average multilanguage developer / sysadmin, I'm impressed by the amount of <em>new</em> knowledge I need to acquire every month to get forward with my work.</p>
<p>Results from Stack Overflow often get in the way sooner than official documentation. For example I had investigated a warning when installing a DNS client, the answer on S.O. allowed me to understand that it was actually an error. When I prefer to see directly the documentation I avoid copy-pasting full errors.</p>
<p>I use the official documentation when answers on S.O. seem to be too &quot;magic&quot; to be blindly trusted or when I need a wider view over a topic.</p>
<p>For many uses, I wrote my personal S.O-like &quot;reference&quot;. I couldn't find a way to get them closer to me than this (maybe print a cheatsheet and hang it to the wall?).</p>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I distinctly remember the spike in productivity when I've learned how to use a search engine (at that time only google). Today the difference is made by Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Any amount of donation one can send to the website is not enough to really give back to the community that make it possible.</p>
<p>Let's hope that they won't become victim of their own success: many successful and appreciated tools made some wrong decisions and alienated the userbase.</p>
<p>Software developers are aften very picky on themes like advertisement, monetization, personal data usage and too many frills on a tool they're using for work.</p>
