            <p>From time to time I receive requests to evaluate a project and assess the initial effort (say, the first 6~12 months). This involves basically the platform and the team costs (usually the latter has more weight than the first).</p>
<p>As simple rule of thumb to quickly get to the point is identifying the three variables that <strong>every</strong> project has:</p>
<ol>
<li>(<code>E</code>) effort: a global indicator of the cost which basically takes into account: development time required by the technical staff, management time from the CEO, how many resources to involve and their seniority.</li>
<li>(<code>T</code>) development time: how quick do you want your cake to be ready? Are in you in a hurry for X and Y reason? Or is this project a &quot;side job&quot; you want to invest some (but not too much) of your time for the moment?</li>
<li>(<code>Q</code>) quality of the platform: do you want a scalable, distributed, bullet-proof cloud-based backend? Or you just need something &quot;online&quot; to showcase to VCs?</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the client can have 2 of these variables, they choose which ones. The CTO (and the development team) has the other one.</p>
<p>Possible scenarios, as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The client picks <code>T</code> + <code>Q</code> and asks for a rock-solid platform (we don't want to rethink the platform again, do we?) in a short time because they have contacts with possible investors and don't want the lead to cool down. The development team then receives the <code>E</code> variable: that is, more effort on the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client picks <code>E</code> + <code>Q</code> as they only have this budget available at this time, but still would like a good platform: developers then receive <code>T</code> and choose to dedicate less time to the project and (for example) push forward other projects or go around with a bicycle chasing crows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure other (more knowledgeable) people have written entire books about this little game of &quot;the three variables&quot; (can't detail too much in five sentences); however, sometimes you don't need to read books cover-to-cover about project management to learn how to start a conversation about a project with a prospect client and underline the basics.</p>
<p>Also, it will quickly raise a useful warning if the client does not want to play by these rules.</p>
