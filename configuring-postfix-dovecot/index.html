<a id="part_i"></a>The itch that needed to be scratched</h3>
<p>I had to move my own server on another machine because the old VPS was aging and due to be turned off soon-ish by the provider.</p>
<p>So I took the chance to re-learn for the n-th time some <i>madz sysamin skillz</i> and configure to the maximum security extend possible the mail server.</p>
<p>First of all, the struggle. Being something that I don't usually do, I always start almost from scratch and have to educate me over terms and protocols like POP3, IMAP, STARTTLS and so on.</p>
<p>Then, the utter hostility of these services towards the poor soul that needs to implement the services. Really a lot of time was spent looking for resources and trying a myriad of different settings until finding the right combo that make everything play along the way I wanted.</p>
<p>Here are some lessons learned.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-t-simply-live-under-a-ssl-rock"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#you-can-t-simply-live-under-a-ssl-rock" aria-label="Anchor link for: you-can-t-simply-live-under-a-ssl-rock">&sect;</a>
<a id="part_ii"></a>You can't simply live under a SSL rock</h3>
<p>I've tried since quite some time to implement the industry best practices and <a href="/2018/09/22/tls-too-soon.html">tried to lock myself in an ideal world</a> where everything has the green sigil of Let's Encrypt.</p>
<p>Well, I've realized that this is simply not possible because there's always a non-negligible percentage of servers that simply don't care as much and if you want to talk with them, you have to be more tolerant.</p>
<p>So you dutifully implement STARTTLS, hoping this will be a hint to move the conversation to a more secure place. Often it won't be the case and you'll still see server from important provider sending in plain text!</p>
<p>I'm appalled by how a lot is discussed about privacy and security but still - in the business world - a lot of sensible documents are exchanged via email in plain text.</p>
<h3 id="mail-protocols-are-insecure-by-design-and-it-shows"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#mail-protocols-are-insecure-by-design-and-it-shows" aria-label="Anchor link for: mail-protocols-are-insecure-by-design-and-it-shows">&sect;</a>
<a id="part_iii"></a>Mail protocols are insecure by design, and it shows</h3>
<p>At the 35C3 I could attend a very interesting talk about the (in)famous <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9463-attacking_end-to-end_email_encryption">Efail S/MIME vulnerability</a> (still not completely resolved!). The speaker showed how the root evil of everything is an inordinate amount of patching over protocols (POP3/SMTP) that are not supposed to be secure, because born in a more trustful world than today. Or, like the Postfix manual aptly says: &quot;In a distant past, the Internet was a friendly environment&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="you-are-a-hamster-running-in-a-wheel"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#you-are-a-hamster-running-in-a-wheel" aria-label="Anchor link for: you-are-a-hamster-running-in-a-wheel">&sect;</a>
<a id="part_iii"></a>You are a hamster running in a wheel</h3>
<p>The moment you start a task like this, you realize you have a long way ahead. Then you patiently make your way in that jungle that is Postfix and Dovecot. Then you succeed and you are - oh - so proud of your server. You'll probably say to yourself: this time I will document everything.</p>
<p>But then I gave up because in the end it doesn't make sense to put all the knowledge of a sysadmin on a Markdown file. I won't simply remember that <em>that</em> setting solved that problem, I cannot write a book with all the steps. Can you write down all the steps and possible pitfalls when compiling a C source code?</p>
<p>And finally you realize that in a month you will have forgotten everything and the next time you'll start from scratch, exactly like this time and time before: you basically live in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/">Groundhog Day movie</a>.</p>
