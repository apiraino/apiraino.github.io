## <a id="part_1" href="#part_1" class="header-anchor">#</a> Introducing Hyper 0.12

I had investigated how Futures work in Rust, the next step was finding a light web framework in Rust to build a microservice so I ended up trying [Hyper](https://hyper.rs). This is the first of a series of tutorials written for myself.

Reading the "label on the tin", Hyper is a high-performance HTTP async server + client that sits on the Tokio runtime and Future crate.

What a Future is, I've put [some notes here](/2019/07/17/rust-future-examples.html).

What the Tokio runtime is ... I don't care! Let's say it's just an engine that acts like a juggler and handles stuff very quickly.

[The guides](https://hyper.rs/guides/) for Hyper are clear enough to get started.

Oh, one big disclaimer before we start. Be sure to look at the latest Hyper `0.12.x` branch. Version `0.13.x` is in the works and changes a number of things (f.e. uses the async/await syntax). Slighly previous versions (like `0.12.15`) have a different API. Hyper is heavily in flux and breaking changes are not properly advertised. You'll find yourself looking at code written for `0.11` that doesn't compile anymore.

But let's see how it works. As far as I could understand the basic principle of Hyper is: it creates a [Service](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.33/hyper/service/trait.Service.html) struct that will handle all requests. I don't care now how all that work, just let me get started.

### <a id="part_1" href="#part_1" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fire up a minimal server

Here we have a server listening for incoming connections and returning a string to each of them as response:

``` rust
// Notice we are using the Future crate re-exported from hyper
// use futures::future;
use hyper::rt::Future;

// this is a "convenience" function to transform any function into a Service
use hyper::service::service_fn_ok;
use hyper::{Body, Request, Response, Server};

fn main() {
    println!("Start");

    let addr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000).into();
    let server = Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(|| {
            // This is the `Service` that will handle the connection.
            // `service_fn_ok` is a helper to convert a function that
            // returns a Response into a `Service`.
            service_fn_ok(move |_: Request<Body>| Response::new(Body::from("Hello World!\n")))
        })
        .map_err(|e| eprintln!("server error: {}", e));

    // runs on tokio runtime
    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);
    hyper::rt::run(server);

    println!("Exiting");
}
```

### <a id="part_2" href="#part_2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Hyper spawns a Future

The server listens for incoming connections and spawns a Future that sleep for 2 seconds.

Notice how che client connection is closed immediately and the Future is resolved at a later stage.

Do *not* use `std::thread::sleep` to add a delay, you'll end up blocking the whole Tokio runtime thread!

``` rust
fn svc_wait(t: u64) -> impl Future<Item = (), Error = ()> {
    println!("[start] waiting...");
    let when = Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(t);
    Delay::new(when)
        .map_err(|e| panic!("timer failed; err={:?}", e))
        .and_then(|_| {
            println!("[end] waiting");
            Ok(())
        })
}

fn main() {
    let addr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000).into();
    let server = Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(|| {
            service_fn_ok(|req: Request<Body>| {
                // received the client connection
                eprintln!("Received client: {:?}", req.headers());
                // creating the future
                let f = svc_wait(2000);
                // the future is run NOW
                hyper::rt::spawn(f);
                // the client receives immediately a reply
                eprintln!("Sending back NOW a response to the client");
                Response::new(Body::from("Future triggered"))
            })
        })
        .map_err(|e| eprintln!("server error: {}", e));

    // runs on tokio runtime
    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);
    hyper::rt::run(server);
}
```

Observe the server logging:

``` bash
# The request to the server will be immediately served, then the connection closed
$ curl localhost:3000
Future triggered

# this is the output you'll see on the server
$ cargo run
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
Received client: {"host": "127.0.0.1:3000", "user-agent": "curl/7.64.0", "accept": "*/*"}
[start] waiting...
Sending back NOW a response to the client
... waiting ...
[end] waiting
```

A reply is being sent immediately to the client. The future is triggered, starts doing its "work" and finishes way after a reply is sent to the client.

### <a id="part_3" href="#part_3" class="header-anchor">#</a> A simple endpoint router, spawns different Futures

We mentioned earlier that the Hyper server runs a [Service](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.33/hyper/service/trait.Service.html) that handles all the requests. This service implements a router that handles a tuple `(http_method, path)` where `http_method` can be GET, POST, etc. and `path` can be (f.e. `/`, `/user`, `/user/:id` and so on).

In the following example, the router handles two endpoints:
- `GET /wait`: triggers the waiting Future seen before
- `GET /fetch`: triggers a request on a remote server

Basically the same as before but with a twist: the request router is itself a Future that resolves when the final Future is resolved.

Full code of this example is [here](https://github.com/apiraino/rust-future-explorations/tree/master/hyper-router). Here we have the interesting bits:

``` rust
fn fetch_data() -> impl Future<Item = future::FutureResult<RespStruct, String>, Error = ()> {
    let uri: Uri = "http://httpbin.org/get".parse().expect("Cannot parse URL");
    Client::new()
        .get(uri)
        // Future is polled here
        .and_then(|res| {
            // extract the body from the Response
            res.into_body().concat2()
        })
        .map_err(|err| println!("error: {}", err))
        .map(|body| {
            // here parse the FutureResult, serialize into a validated Struct
            let decoded: RespStruct = serde_json::from_slice(&body).expect("Couldn't deserialize");
            future::ok(decoded)
        })
}

fn svc_wait(t: u64) -> impl Future<Item = (), Error = ()> {
    // code omitted for brevity
}

// Just an alias to make it more readable
type BoxFut = Box<dyn Future<Item = Response<Body>, Error = hyper::Error> + Send>;

// This is our request router
fn service_router(req: Request<Body>) -> BoxFut {
    let mut response = Response::new(Body::empty());

    // routes the request to the appropriate worker
    match (req.method(), req.uri().path()) {

         // GET /wait
        (&Method::GET, "/wait") => {
            let r = svc_wait(1500);
            hyper::rt::spawn(r);
            *response.body_mut() = Body::from(format!("Triggered waiting {}ms", 1500));
        }

         // GET /fetch
        (&Method::GET, "/fetch") => {
            let r = fetch_data().map(|x| {
                println!("got data: {:?}", x);
            });
            hyper::rt::spawn(r);
            *response.body_mut() = Body::from("Sent request to external webservice");
        }

        // ... more routers

    }
    eprintln!("Returning a response");
    Box::new(future::ok(response))
}

fn main() {
    let addr = ([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000).into();
    let server = Server::bind(&addr)
        .serve(|| {
            // now we spawn a Future with our request router
            service_fn(service_router)
        })
        .map_err(|e| eprintln!("server error: {}", e));

    println!("Listening on http://{}", addr);
    hyper::rt::run(server);
}
```

Now you can call the server on two endpoints:

``` bash
$ curl localhost:3000/wait
Triggered waiting 1500ms

$ curl localhost:3000/fetch
Sent request to external webservice
```

More examples can be found on [the Hyper GitHub repo](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/tree/v0.12.33/examples) but without a proper context they didnt make too much sense to me (your mileage may vary). Maybe a bit more explaination of they actual do should suffice.
