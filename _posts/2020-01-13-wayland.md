title: "Wayland: worth a try?"
---

After watching a talk about the [Hikari window manager](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-87-x11-and-wayland-a-tale-of-two-implementations), I was slightly horrified by how Wayland have been released since 10 years and still X11 is everywhere. So I decided to try it and see why.

The summary is: if you use Gnome (maybe also KDE through KWin?), Wayland may be usable for the average user. On the other hand, if you use a more niche window manager, it will be more fun :-)

An important limitation about Wayland: screen sharing applications (conferencing and WebRTC apps webapps) seems to not work well at this time (this is a dealbreaker for many).

This said, a lot of X11 applications will work under Wayland because of some magic provided by [Xwayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html), an X11 client that forwards all Wayland events to X11 seamlessy; in the end this means that you can stay on a mixed X11/Wayland desktop and migrate at your own pace (or - more likely - at the pace of development of applications you need to support Wayland).

So, on a recent Ubuntu 19.x, I simplyn had to logout and login again using Gnome/Wayland. Done. Enjoy Wayland and find what's not working.

If you use another window manager, read on, here be dragons.

Under X I use [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org), so the obvious choice was to install the [Sway window manager](https://swaywm.org/) which provides almost full compatibility with i3 config files (in my case just small adjustements). I've immediately noticed an annoying name clash with a Microsoft product, so search results are always a bit dirty. I am confident that the window manager will outlive the Microsoft product, so I'll just wait :-)

Important gotcha about Sway: won't work with nVIDIA proprietary driver but will work with Nouveau, [Hacker news discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21628494).

The basic Sway configuration works fine, the fun starts when you need to customize and add features.

Some sparse tips:

- To see if an application is running under XWayland, use `xeyes` and hover over the application. If the eyes follow your cursor, that's a X11 application running through Xwayland.

- Add these env variables for toolkits and applications to make them run on Wayland:
  - GTK: `GDK_BACKEND=wayland`
  - Qt: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland-egl`
  - Clutter: `CLUTTER_BACKEND=wayland`
  - SDL: `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland`

- Check if we are running Wayland
  ``` bash
  $ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
  wayland
  ```

### <a id="part_3" href="#part_3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Replacements

Besides rewriting parts of my [i3 scripts](https://gitlab.com/apiraino/dotfiles/tree/master/i3) to adjust them for Wayland, I'd like to replace my current X11 applications and utilities with "native" ones to see how far I can go. Here's a list I will keep updated:

- `xclip`: [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard)
- `dmenu`: [dmenu-wayland](https://github.com/nyyManni/dmenu-wayland)
- `mpv`: works fine
- Firefox/Thunderbird: currently broken, must be used under Xwayland. One can try setting `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1`. There is a `firefox-wayland` package but reports do not indicate to work very well. [Tracking issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=635134).
- `dmenu`: [dmenu-wl](https://github.com/nyyManni/dmenu-wayland)
- `py3status` (a better status bar for i3): [swaybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)
- [Gnome application Wayland support](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland/Applications)
  - `blueman-amanager`: supports Wayland
  - `nm-applet`: supports Wayland (but broken: workaround is to force X11 backend, e.g. `GDK_BACKEND=X11 nm-applet --indicator`)
  - `gnome-terminal`: supports Wayland
  - `gnome-screenshot`: broken

### <a id="part_4" href="#part_4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Open issues

- Cannot copy and paste anymore to and from Emacs: the issue is with the `xclip.el` package, it does not use correctly `wl-clipboard`. Opened a [bug report](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=39103).
- `wl-clipboard` shows weird visual artifacts, (also reflects when using in Emacs with `xclip.el`, appends `^M` whitespaces).
- Thunderbird: the UI blocks until checking all mailboxes is finished
- Firefox: sporadic UI blocks
- screen lock (on lid close) sometimes doesn't work (screen is not locked before sleep mode)
- Sometimes the WiFi network is disconnected
- Sway sporadic crashes (esp. when reloading the configuration)
- `nm-applet` crashes when getting connection information, [issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/network-manager-applet/issues/64)
