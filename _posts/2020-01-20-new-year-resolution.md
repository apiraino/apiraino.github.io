I wrote [my wishlist for Rust](/2019/11/04/call-for-2020-roadmap.html), so I can write one for me, too.

- Rust 2020: more code, less talk

- Drop X11/i3 and switch to Wayland/SwayWM

- Any reimbursement I will receive (up to 50 eur) will go directly either to the FSFE, the EFF, Wikimedia or similar organization working on raising awareness on privacy, censorship issues and free/libre software. Or to a FOSS project.

- I will not write a "smiley emoji" if I don't mean it.

This should be doable.
