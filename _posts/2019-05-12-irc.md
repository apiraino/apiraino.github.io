A quick HOWTO guide for nick managment on IRC

- How do I register a nick? `/msg NickServ register <password> <email>` then follow the instructions received by email

- How do I login with my nick? `/msg NickServ identify <pwd>`

- How do I change my password: `/msg NickServ SETPASS <nick> <code_received_by_email> <pwd>`

- How do I reclaim my nick? You should contact an admin. The nick can be claimed if not used for some time (see IRC server policies)

### Using IRC from EMACS

[See my EMACS config](https://github.com/apiraino/emacs_reference/blob/27331707bceb85b6b21b459f8f13db03bf459c7b/.emacs.d/personal/jman.el)

Format of the `authinfo` file for IRC credentials:
```
machine <irc server> port nickserv user <nick> password <pwd>
```
