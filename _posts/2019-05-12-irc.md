A quick HOWTO guide for nick managment on IRC

- How do I register a nick?
```
/msg NickServ register <password> <email>
```

then follow the instructions received by email

- How do I login with my nick?

You should contact an admin. The nick can be claimed if not used for some time (see IRC server policies)
