A quick HOWTO guide for nick managment on IRC

- How do I register a nick?
```
/msg NickServ register <password> <email>
```

then follow the instructions received by email

- How do I login with my nick?
```
/msg NickServ identify <password>
```

- How do I reclaim my nick?

You should contact an admin. The nick can be claimed if not used for some time (see IRC server policies)

- Using IRC from EMACS

[See my EMACS config](https://github.com/apiraino/emacs_reference/blob/27331707bceb85b6b21b459f8f13db03bf459c7b/.emacs.d/personal/jman.el)
