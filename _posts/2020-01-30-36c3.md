title: Back from 36c3
---

I still have in my stash a list of the most interesting events I've experienced at the 36C3, [the Chaos Communication Congress at its 36th year](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019). For my future reference, I'm listing them here.

- Things started immediately funny. The train to the location was cancelled, so we had to figure out another train to get there. I helped a 92 (yes, ninety-two) years old lady figuring out the train to take to the congress location as she was confused by the train cancellation (clearly she wasnt't attending the congress). Helped her finding a seat in the crowded train we took as replacement. I wish I will be that lively at her age.

- Learned about [delta.chat](https://delta.chat/de), recently rewritten in Rust. It was interesting listening to one of the maintainers, about their userbase in countries where internet bandwidth is at a premium.

- Learned about how bad regulations and a poor development process can lead to [Boeing airplanes to crash](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10961-boeing_737max_automated_crashes).

- Learned about the ongoing organizational process during the [Hong Kong protests](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10933-what_the_world_can_learn_from_hongkong).

- Quantum computing is cool, but [not near any practical use](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11039-quantum_computing_are_we_there_yet).

- Interesting speculations about the CIA providing [manned weapons to Syrian militants against Russian army](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10642-harry_potter_and_the_not-so-smart_proxy_war), the "Protego" documents in the Vault 7 Wikileaks of 2 years ago. Also, a frightening glimpse on how war technology has evolved.

- Hacking the [PS4 Blu-ray drive](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10567-hacking_sony_playstation_blu-ray_drives) or - in other words - how to responsibly release a security vulnerability, get some money from Sony and not have your ass sued. And perhaps have Sony obtain a partial public security disclosure.

- Java Tomcat (!) webservices are still king [in industrial complexes](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10689-on_the_insecure_nature_of_turbine_control_systems_in_power_generation).

- Interesting demonstration on how to use the [TPM cryptographic chip inside our computers](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10564-hacking_with_a_tpm). This goes straight in my TODO list!

- A funny and thought-provoking form of art vandalism [to boycott Facebook events](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11178-art_against_facebook).

- Learned about [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), a really interesting programming language to create music sequencers.

- Also, an interesting talk by Moxie Marlinspike from Signal [on how a decentralized messaging system is not working](https://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/12be5396-2a25-4ec8-a92a-674b1cb6b270) (and then be grilled with questions). This talk was removed from the CCC Mediatek on request of the speaker.

And I've only scratched the surface of the Congress.

In a sense, the 36C3 goes on after you leave: here's the huge list of talks [here](https://media.ccc.de/c/36c3?sort=view_count).

After the Congress, I've also discovered a nice surprise that I will document separately.

Oh, yes, and managed to get a bad cold, I'd spent New Year's Eve at home with a hot tea :-(
